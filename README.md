# Emotion Detection Web Application (NLP) 


## About The Project

I developed a web app for an e-commerce company to analyze customer emotions regarding their signature products. This app utilizes the Watson NLP Library's Emotion Predict function to categorize text-based feedback into five emotions: anger, sadness, joy, disgust, and fear. The app also features robust error handling, gracefully managing situations where users submit blank feedback.
